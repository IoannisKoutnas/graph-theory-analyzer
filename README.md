# Graph Theory Analysis – Karate Club

An interactive Python tool built with Tkinter and Matplotlib to explore **graph theory algorithms** such as BFS, DFS, greedy coloring, and clique detection on the classic **Karate Club network**.

---

## Features
- Visualizes **BFS** and **DFS** traversals step-by-step using animation.
- Implements **Greedy Graph Coloring** with dynamic color mapping.
- Detects **Cycles** and finds the **Maximum Clique**.
- Logs all algorithmic steps in an interactive UI console.
